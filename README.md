a novel approach that combines RGB and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) modalities using a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the accuracy and robustness of cancer detection. Our method leverages the complementary information provided by both modalities and addresses the challenge of HSI availability by training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct HSI from RGB images when HSI data is unavailable. 


Experiment 1: RGB Image Classification of Cancer Cells Using CNN Model In this experiment, the model architecture employed transfer learning, leveraging the pre-trained InceptionV3 model as the base model. 


Experiment 2: Hyperspectral Image Classification of Cancer Cells Using CNN Model
The HSI data was divided into training and validation sets, and an HSIImageDataGenerator class was created to efficiently handle the loading, preprocessing, and augmentation of the hyperspectral images. The generator class also handles the parsing of the corresponding header files to extract essential information such as image dimensions and datatype.The3DCNNarchitecture used in this experiment consists of three convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and max-pooling layers. After the last convolutional layer, the features are flattened and passed through a dense layer with 32 units and a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.15 to prevent overfitting. Finally, a dense layer with three output units and a softmax activation function is employed, as we aim to classify the input HSI data into three distinct cancer levels.


Experiment 3: RGB Image Classification of Cancer Cells using multimodal CNN
The pre-trained RGB and HSI models were then loaded, and their base models were extracted by removing the last classification layers. These base models were set as non-trainable to preserve the learned features. The inputs of both base models were then fed to a fusion layer, which concatenated the features from both modalities. A fully connected layer followed by a regularized dense layer with 16 neurons and a ReLU activation function was added to the concatenated features. The output layer consisted of three neurons with a SoftMax activation function to classify the three classes.


Experiment 4: Hyperspectral Image Generation Using GANs
generate Hyperspectral Images (HSI) from RGB images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The code provided first processes the RGB and HSI images, which are stored in lists in such a way that images are matching to the same scene. The images are then normalized to improve the training process. It then defines the generator and discriminator models for the GAN. The generator consists of a series of Convolutional and Transposed Convolutional layers, while the discriminator is composed of Convolutional layers followed by a Flatten layer and a Dense layer 
with a sigmoid activation function. Both models use Leaky ReLU activation functions and Batch Normalization layers.
